* Swift is modern, fast, type safe and easy to learn
* Swift is used to write XCUITest for Apple platform apps.

### Why XCUITest?
* Native and Fast
* Same Teck Stack used for app development
* Collaboration with app developers
* Easy to integrate with CI/CD
* Improved Accessibility

### XCUITest-Downside
* No Cross-platform
* Only used with Swift and Objective-C

### XCTest
* Unit Testing
* Integration and Network Testing
